# Pothole Detection with Classical Computer Vision

This project aims to detect potholes in road images using **classical computer vision algorithms** without machine learning or deep learning â€” as a first step toward building a training dataset or deploying lightweight solutions.

## Objective

- Develop modular Python scripts to detect potholes under different real-world scenarios:
  - Centered and well-lit
  - Displaced or partially visible
  - Seen in angled perspective
  - Far away or low-resolution
  - With distracting elements like shadows, tires, bags, etc.
